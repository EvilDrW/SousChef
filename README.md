# SousChef
Cordova/Angular 2+ Recipe App for Android

This is a cordova app for viewing recipes on a phone or tablet.  I personally use it to put my favorite <a href="https://www.cooksillustrated.com">Cook's Illustrated</a> recipes onto an old tablet I just had lying around.  This way I can see the recipe while cooking, find the recipes I want without having to flip through dozens of issues, and avoid any further destruction of the magazines themselves.

This is a really simple app.  I mostly did it to learn Angular 2+, cordova, etc.

To build it into an apk, go into the ng-souschef directory and run 

```ng build```

When that's done, go into the cordova-souschef directory and run

```cordova build android```

I don't own any Apple devices, so while I think building it for iOS should just work, I am not able to try it to be sure.
